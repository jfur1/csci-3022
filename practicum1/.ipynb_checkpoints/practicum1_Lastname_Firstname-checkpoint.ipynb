    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Monday March 4**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",

Here are some rules:\n",

    "- Players begin at START and may choose to begin the game by either going to college (moving to the right from START) or starting a career (moving downward from START). Players then move along the game board in order of increasing tile number. \n",
    "    - If a player begins by going to college, then they start the game with -\\$20,000. That is indeed negative money, to account for student loan debt.\n",
    "    - If a player begins by starting a career, then they start the game with \\$5,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a player reaches a red square (tiles 9, 17 or 30), they must stop at that square for the rest of their turn, even if they would not have landed on the red square.\n",
    "    - When a player stops on the CAREER tile after college (square 9), they are randomly assigned a career and salary from the possibilities: \\$50,000, \\$70,000, \\$90,000, \\$110,000, or \\$130,000 (all with equal probability). The player's actual career is irrelevant to the game, but please make something up so you are emotionally invested in the game.\n",
    "    - If a player starts a career at the beginning of the game, they are assigned a salary randomly from possibilities \\$40,000, \\$50,000, \\$60,000, \\$70,000, or \\$80,000.\n",
    "    - When a player stops on the HOUSE tile, they put a down payment on a house. This down payment is drawn randomly from the set \\$25,000, \\$40,000, \\$55,000 or \\$70,000.\n",
    "    - When a player stops on the RETIRE tile, the player collects a pension equal to half their salary and then the game ends immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a player lands on or passes a PAYDAY square, they earn money equal to their salary.\n",

    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a player lands on a STRIFE square (1, 4, 7, 13, 18, 23 or 29 if they go to college, or 2, 7, 13, 18, 23 or 29 if they start a career immediately at the beginning of the game), they draw a STRIFE card. The STRIFE cards have the player earn \\$5,000 or \\$10,000, or lose \\$1,000, \\$2,000 or \\$5,000.\n",
