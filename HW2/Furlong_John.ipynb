Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail. As soon as a player rolls doubles, they are let out of Jail and their turn ends. Let $D$ represent the event that a player rolls doubles.\n",

    "Sonic and Amy are two average hedgehogs who have to run around campus every day for classes and hobbies. When they leave the Engineering Center (E) from their Data Science class, they like to go to 5 other places on campus: the Gym ($G~$) to exercise, the Library ($L~$) to learn, the Hill ($H~$) to grab a sandwich, Weathertech Cafe ($W~$) for a pizza, and the mountains ($M~$) to frolic with their marmot friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some rules governing their movements throughout the fair city of Boulder:\n",
    "* When Sonic and/or Amy is leaving one location, they randomly select one of the available adjacent locations, with equal probability.\n",
    "* This includes back-tracking, but note that to return to their original location would require 2 moves.\n",
    "* Assume that all moves require the same amount of time.\n",
    "* They are also not allowed to stay put; they always must move to some *other* adjacent location.\n",
    "* Sonic and Amy also act **independently** of one another. That is, the probability that Sonic goes from one place to another is independent of Amy's movements.\n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\">Monopoly</a>).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50 or \\$100, or pay the bank \\$25 or \\$100.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 20 is **Free Parking**. If a player lands on Square 20, then they are awarded a Free Parking Bonus of \\$500. This should be a generic input variable to your `miniopoly_turn` function called `bonus`, so you can modify it later. But, the default value for `bonus` should be \\$500.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 30 is **Go To Jail**. (So if a player has landed on Square 30, then you know they have been to jail.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the player rolls doubles (i.e. the dice have equal values), then the player moves from Square 10 a number of squares equal to the sum of the dice\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles, then she pays the bank \\$20 and remains in **Jail** \n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player passes or lands on **GO** (square 0) she collects \\$200. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player lands on any other square not mentioned above, she pays the bank an amount equal to the square's number (e.g. if she lands on Square 29 she pays the bank \\$29). \n",

    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any point the player has \\$0 or less they go bankrupt and the game ends.\n",

It should take as arguments the player's current location on the board as well as the player's current cash reserves and the amount of the Free Parking (Square 20) bonus, and return the player's new location and cash reserves after the turn has completed. Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.\n",
